### Abstract from seminar
This seminar aims to research machine learning field of MER, find what are the most successful algorithms and methods for MER, test them and present test results. In the main part of this seminar a system that predicts valence and arousal of a song from music features extracted with LibROSA Python library and the help of three different machine learning algorithms, which are Random Forest Regression (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Network Regression (NN). For training of models MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis (DEAM) dataset was used and PMEmo2019 dataset was used for testing. Special emphasis was put on testing different feature sets for model training.
